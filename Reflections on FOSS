From what I've found so far, Sonic Pi doesn't have an IRC, but it does have a browser-based chat service hosted by some separate company (is it IRC based?).  It doesn't seem to be very active, however, with the most recent message sent last month.

I'm not sure if there is a "mail list" service or not.  I need to look around further to confirm this.

There is an active forum: https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/.  It seems to be mainly populated by users, but there is a subforum about development.  That subforum isn't too active, the last post was made 16 days ago, and it requires a user to be a Patreon supporter in order to post, but you can still view the individual threads.  Recent threads are about SynthDefs and their use in SuperCollider.  There is a post I've found that may help me with installing a (newer) version of Sonic Pi on my laptop.

Within the Github Issues tracker I found a recent post related to undiagnosed memory issues.  A user is having problems running a specific song script on their Raspberri Pi because it slowly takes up all memory.  It is replicable by other users.  It has been supposed that it is a Ruby issue, but experimentation seems to point away from that.
